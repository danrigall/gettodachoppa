            <p>This game is in no way affiliated with or sanctioned by the Honorable Arnold Schwarzenegger (may he live forever,
                etc.), 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, or any other corporate entity I may forgotten. It is intended as an
                homage to my favorite action star of all time and the movies I grew up watching that still today provide some of
                the most memorable quotes.</p>

            <p>Gabe Rigall is an independent programmer/web developer/data analyst/machine learning enthusiast/evil genius who
                grew up watching Arnold Schwarzenegger movies and playing card, board, and videogames. The inspiration for "Get
                to Da Choppa" came after a particularly riveting bout of "Marrying Mr. Darcy" wherein his wife soundly beat him
                to the punch (pun intended).</p>
